          "question": "What is equity crowdfunding and how is it different from traditional crowdfunding?",
          "answer": "Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising many small amounts of money from a large number of people via the Internet. There are essentially two types of crowdfunding platforms. The first type of crowdfunding platform offers products or rewards in exchange for your funding commitment. Typical sites include: Kickstarter and IndieGogo. The second type, which is one that Wunderfund.co runs, allows individuals to invest in a startup company in exchange for a percentage share (or equity) in that company. This fundraising method was legalized by the JOBS Act in 2012 and it's subsequent revision with Title III in 2015."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does the Wunderfund Platform work?",
          "answer": "We look for companies that have a chance of building a business that we believe in. Once a startup company launches a fundraising campaign, investors are given an opportunity to back the startup with an investment commitment. Ultimately, the crowd decides whether the campaign will reach their target goal. If that target goal is not met by the campaign deadline (usually 90-120 days), then the project goes unfunded, and your commitment is released."

          "question": "How is equity crowdfunding different from typical venture financing?",
          "answer": "In short, we see equity crowdfunding as a step in deregulating the venture capital industry. Prior to May 2016, only wealthy accredited investors (i.e. individuals who earned >$200K a year or whose net worth was >$1M) were allowed to invest in startups. Even the early equity crowdfunding sites were only dedicated to serving wealthy indviduals. But with the recent change of Title III of the Jobs Act, now everyday investors like you can invest in a startup using equity crowdfunding sites like Wunderfund.co."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much money do I need to start investing?",
          "answer": "You can invest as little as $100 in a startup company and up to a maximum limit that's based on the SEC's Regulation Crowdfunding guidelines. Wunderfund.co will automatically calculate the limit you can invest based on your annual income and net worth you provide. Legally, we cannot allow you to invest more than the guidelines set by the SEC for every 12 month period: \n All investors can invest a least $2,000 \n If either your income or net worth are less than $100K, you may invest up to 5% of the smaller number. \n If both your income or net worth is >$100K, you can invest up to 10% of the smaller number. \n $100K is the maximum amount accredited investors can invest (i.e. people who earn $200K in annually or $300K jointly) or those have over $1M in assets. \n Regardless, we'll automatically calculate your maximum limit for you and you'll be able to see how much you are allowed to invest in your investor profile page."

          "question": "Why did you create the Wunderfund Platform?",
          "answer": "People in Cincinnati are excited about the fast growing entrepreneurial ecosystem in their backyard. It's transforming neighborhoods, creating jobs, and revitalizing the economy. In fact, the Cincinnati region is considered the fastest growing midwest economy, and includes incubators, accelerators, and universities creating thousands of new startups. The problem is that many of these new startups are looking for capital, but it's getting increasingly harder to raise capital. The bottom line is there is a greater demand for capital than there is available capital from institutional VCs and angels. That's why we want to democratize venture capital for the general public, and enable everyday people who are excited about the city's growth, but don't yet know how to engage. Now they can with Wunderfund.co."

        {
          "question": "How does the investment process work?",
          "answer": "We worked hard to make it as simple as possible to commit to an invesment. Simply create an account, verify your accreditation status, select an investment that works for you, signing legal documents and funding the investment. When an investment is made, the money is held in escrow until the deal closes. Once the investment target is met, the money is transferred to the project company for the sole purpose of the specific property being invested in."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can anyone invest using this portal or do you have to be an accredited investor?",
          "answer": "Before May 16, 2016, only wealthy people and banks were considered 'accredited investors' and allowed to invest in private companies. All that has changed with the Jobs Act, which allows the average American to invest using regulation crowdfunding. Although this has opened up a huge gate for investors, there are still some limitations on the amounts you can invest each year. Wunderfund.co will automatically let you know how much you can invest based on your annual income and net worth you set up in your profile."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens when rounds are oversubscribed?",
          "answer": "If the company chooses to do so, they will accept oversubscriptions for the fundraising amount, usually setting a limit of how much they can accept. If they choose to do so, the campaign will close either when the date hits, or they hit their oversubscription limit. If it hits the limit, your investment will go through."
        },
        {
          "question": "How are contracts signed?",
          "answer": "All the signatures are handled electronically. once a contract is signed by both parties, a PDF copy of the executed forms will be emailed to all parties for their record keeping. A copy of your contract will also be available on Wunderfund.co in your profile."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the minimum and maximum amount I can invest?",
          "answer": "The minimum investment is typically $100. However, the minimum could be set higher by the issuer who launches the campaign. These will be disclosed on their offering page."
        },
        {
          "question": "How are investments pre-vetted before being listed?",
          "answer": "In order for an issuer's campaign can be listed publically on our platform, we conduct a full review of the the issuer's application. The appication includes a business plan, the financials, articles of organization, and other important documents. We then conduct a background & credit check on the issuer's founding team members & sponsors. Importantly, these measures don't take away the risks in the investment and Wunderfund.co cannot gaurantee results. What the vetting process aims to do is put quality startup companies for you to select from so you get quality deal flow. You as an investor have the full authority and discretion to choose which opportunity is right for you and how much you want to invest."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it okay if I've issued equity before via another crowdfunding site?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can issue equity even after you've done so on another crowdfunding site, however you are prevented by law from running multiple campaigns on different platforms at the same time. That would be in violation of guidelines set by the SEC."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long is the investment period?",
          "answer": "The timeframe depends on the investment type. Equity based investments can range as long as 5-10 years. Revenue sharing models and loan based investments can pay back in shorter time frames. You'll be able to see what the expected period of investment is before you commit to an investment."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this free to join?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can join Wunderfund.co for free. You can also browse any of the investments on the site to see what's currently available to invest in. However, if you want access to an issuer's secured documents, growth plans, and other important information that will inform you before you invest, you have to create an account and sign in."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is startup investing and is it for me?",
          "answer": "Investors who back startups do so for different reasons. For us, we believe in founders who have great vision, purpose, and a great idea that has a possibility for a return. You should know that investing in a startup means you're willing to take that risk of losing it all if the startup fails."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are equity investments?",
          "answer": "Equity investments are high risk/high return investments. They are inherently risky and there's a risk you could lose every dollar you invest in a startup. You also have to wait over 5+ years for a return in some cases. Equity investments are definitely not like the stock market where you can buy and sell your shares. Startup companies will either fail or succeed. Success happens if or when they are acquired or go public with an IPO. So, you must believe in the companies and their success before putting any money into them."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are debt investments?",
          "answer": "Debt loans are less risky and also carry less of a potential return compared to equity investments.  Importanlty, there's a still a risk that a loan may not get paid back, so as with any investment on the Wunderfund platform, you should only invest what you can afford to lose."
        },
        {
          "question": "Am I able to resell my investment?",
          "answer": "It's best to expect you cannot resell your investment. Regulation Crowdfunding law restricts the resale of securities for at least one year, and after that, it can only be sold back to a restricted group of individuals (i.e. the issuer, an accredited investor, a family member, or trust). Plus, there is no open stock market exchange where you can buy or sell your equity. Lastly, all the equity based securities on Wunderfund.co are prohibited for resale based on the terms & conditions set by the issuer to protect the number of shareholders on their cap table."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will my percentage ownership be reduced over time? ",
          "answer": "Yes, that's what the industry calls dilution and can be quite normal. For instance, if a startup is successful and is growing fast, it may need additional rounds of financing to support the growth. Provided the company's value increases, during the subsequent round of financing, additional shares of stock is issued to new investors to help fuel their growth. "
        },
        {
          "question": "How is startup investing different from investing in the stock market?",
          "answer": "Startup investing is very risky and much different from stock market investing. The stock market allows you to buy and trade shares in an open exchange at anytime. Startup investing does not operate in the same way. When you invest in a startup, you will tie up your money for an extended period and the result is binary. The desired result is for the startup to get acquired or goes public, which would liquidate the investment and pay out to investors. But startups have a high risk of failure, and if they do, you could lose all the money you invested."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there ways to decrease the risk of startup investing?",
          "answer": "Diversifying your portfolio is certainly important so you don't have all your investment eggs in one basket. Some investors like to back startups on a product or service they would actually use. While other investors like to back startups that operate in an industry they have experience in. Regardless of how you diversify, always do your homework so you can make an informed decision."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I cancel my investment and get a full refund?",
          "answer": "If you want to cancel an investment, you have up to 48 hours of the end of the campaign deadline to get a full refund. After those last 48 hours, you can no longer cancel your investment."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can the issuing startup or Wunderfund.co cancel my investment?",
          "answer": "It's possible, but will likely not happen often. The startups have cancellation rights in their legal terms and could cancel for any reason. A likely scenario is that they discover that a competitor is trying to invest in the company to gain information. That only seems fair for them to be able to cancel, right? Only when the fundraising round is closed, and the funds have been transferred from the escrow account, will you be sure that your investment cannot be canceled."
        },
        {
          "question": "When does the fundraising round close?",
          "answer": "A fundraising round will close at their offering deadline. However, if a campaign is not taking over-subscription, the round will close when the funding target has been met. If the company decides to extend their fundraising deadline, you will be notified via email and you have 48 hours to reconfirm your investment."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if the campaign doesn't reach its funding goal?",
          "answer": "If a campaign does not reach its funding goal, you will be notified via email and receieve a full refund of that specific investment. "
        },
        {
          "question": "How long will it take to receive my refund?",
          "answer": "We'll initiate a refund as fast as possible but it can take up to 7 days since we use a third party payment method."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can I track campaigns I've invested in?",
          "answer": "Anyone can view the status of a campaign in progress from the browse page, which will show all active offerings. You can see how much has been raised to date, and how many days are left before the offering closes. If you want to review your previous investments, you can track that on your investor profile page. There you can see which campaigns you've commited to as well as the history of the ones you've already invested in the past."
        },
        {
          "question": "What updates should I expect after investing?",
          "answer": "The founders are required to issue an annual update at least once a year at a minimum, but we do encourage founders to provide quarterly updates via email or newsletter (though it's not a requirement)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What relationship will a company have with investors post-closing?",
          "answer": "Every company is different where some are more engaged with investors who tend to be it's most loyal customers too. These additional rights are typically spelled out in the investor agreement documents."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there a way I can personally help the startups I invest in?",
          "answer": "Some of the best help you can give is by becoming an advocate for the startup. Introduce them to potential partnerships, sales opportunities, and other relevant people in your network. "
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I receive an annual report?",
          "answer": "For all Regulation Crowdfunding offerings, the issuing company will provide an annual report with all their financial statements and a state of the business. This is required to be sent 3 months after the end of the fiscal year (which can be different from calendar year). There are situations where they are not obligated to provide an annual report. For instance, if the company is acquired, issues an IPO, your investment is repurchased. Other instances are if they have <300 shareholders after year 1, go bankrupt, or have less than $10M in assets after 3 years. On rare occassions, a startup may decide not to file an annual report, because they do not plan to do another Regulation crowdfunding campagn and find that venture capitalists are throwing money at them. In that rare case, you won't have the current financial information."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I earn a return?",
          "answer": "The companies that raise money on Wunderfund.co are private companies who will issue a SAFE note also known as a convertible note to their investors. This simply means that your investment amount will convert to stock when a proper value is placed on the company, which typically happens when the company raises a subsequent investment round from instutional investors who put a price on the company. If the company grows successfully, the value of the stock increases with each round of financing until the company is acquired or goes public in an IPO at which point you can sell your shares."
        },
        {
          "question": "How are payments collected and remitted to investors?",
          "answer": "If a company is successfully acquired, Wunderfund.co will collect the payments directly through a third party servicing company and will remit the payments directly to investors net any processing fees. All projected returns or distributions along with the schedule are unique to each offering and will be clearly spelled out in the offering page for that campaign."
        },
        {
          "question": "How is the value of a company determined?",
          "answer": "Startups are valued based on the market demand determined by the professional investors looking to invest in them. The valuation can flluctuate over time based on the age & stage of the company as it grows and matures. Generally, early stage companies are worth less than later stage companies that have raised several rounds of financing."

        {
          "question": "Why should I consider crowdfunding to raise capital?",
          "answer": "A crowd of investors can validate your product in a way that institutional investors cannot. They understand your product from a customer standpoint and can give you feedback from the platform. With crowdfunding, if they're already customers, now you're enabling them to become owners, and with that you'll have brand ambassadors."

          "question": "Does it cost money to create a basic profile?",
          "answer": "It's free to sign up, build a profile, and start a campaign. If your campaign is successful, we take 5-7% of the funds based on how much your company raises."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I create a profile and not raise funds or commit to investing?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. We suggest creating a basic profile to understand how the process works on both sides and to start collecting followers before starting to fundraise."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there legal issues I need to be aware of when creating a campaign?",
          "answer": "When you build a crowdfunding campaign, the biggest watchout is making any false promises. As a new company, you can't predict the future, so promising explicit revenue targets and specific growth numbers can be misleading. You are liable for every statement that is not true. Since you're dealing with investors now, you also cannot withhold relevant information that could affect their decision to invest (e.g. a pending lawsuit). Read our Legal Fast Start Guide for more information."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there eligibility requirements for my company to create a campaign?",
          "answer": "Before you can issue an offering on Wunderfund.co, you have to apply and tell us about your team and your company. We look for a complete business plan, pitch deck, financial information, and other relevant historical information that we review for preliminary due diligence. Only companies that get through this preliminary due diligence criteria will be permitted to raise funding.

          "answer": "The maximum amount to raised it up to $1 million. (it's more than this now, right??) Although we have no set minimum, we encourage companies to raise no less than $50,000 on this portal."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are the company's confidential documents secure? Can anyone see those?",
          "answer": "Only approved investors logged into the portal will be able to see confidential documents that you upload for your campaign. Basic information about your company will be shared to any anonymous users in order for the investor community to make informed investment decisions. As long as appropriate disclosure is made and those disclosures are true and accurate, each company chooses the exact information that is shared."

        },
        {
          "question": "How do I know if I'm ready to start fundraising on Wunderfund?",
          "answer": "We fund companies at all stages but we recommend that if you fundraise on Wunderfund.co, you have some proof points that can convince investors you can 'get stuff done' and not just in the idea stage. While there are no requirements, we recommend at least one experienced investor that publicly endorses your company. It also helps to have at least a working prototype, and ideally, a few paying customers. But before then, create a free profile, and start collecting followers!"
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I edit my campaign even after it is launched?",
          "answer": "Yes, your campaign is editable after it is launched. Note that any change made after it is launched and you have backer, they will have to be notified of any changes and then have to re-commit their investor."
        },
        {
          "question": "How many investors can participate in a round?",
          "answer": "This depends on the minimum investment size, which you can set when you build your campaign. For example, if you set a minimum investment size of $1,000 on a target goal of $100,000, it's possible 100 investors could participate in the round. It's common for investors to make larger investment sizes than the minium, which would affect the maximum number."

          "question": "Will all the investors have voting rights?",
          "answer": "Minor investors who invest less than $25,000 do not have voting rights. As for anyone who invests more than $25,000 into a specific company, they do have voting rights in the company."
        },

          "question": "What rights will investors who invest through Wunderfund have?",
          "answer": "Your company will set the investors rights where this is structured in the terms of the type of offering and investor agreement. We have a standard template you can use, which you can choose to review with your own legal counsel."
        },
        {
          "question": "At what points am I allowed to promote my campaign?",
          "answer": "You can begin promoting your campaign only after it is enabled on Wunderfund.co. Before then, you can publicly share your personal profile, and ask others to 'follow you'. However you cannot legally say that you are in fundraising mode or share any details about your planned offering until it's officialled launched. Per legal guidelines, you are not allowed to say, 'we plan to begin fundraising on July 4th a total raise of $500K.' You must also avoid saying things like, 'Once we file with the SEC...' They frown upon that."
        },
        {
          "question": "What legal considerations should I be concerned about when advertising?",
          "answer": "You can promote after the form C is filed with the SEC. Importantly, filing a Form C is not an 'approval' or 'endorsement' from the SEC. So definitely avoid advertising with any statements referring to the SEC. At this point, you can advertise in any channel you want, whether it's email, social media, youtube, or on a flyer you pass out on the streets. What's important is that your advertisements must be based on objective facts about your company. You certainly cannot say 'Invest in the the Best darn company on the planet'). All your adverstising must include a link to your Wunderfund.co profile. More info about this is within our Legal Guide."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I close my campaign?",
          "answer": "Once the deadline hits, the campaign will automatically close and not accept anymore investors. If the funding goal was reached, investors will be notified and it will take about 5 days for the funds to go through."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if my campaign doesn't reach its funding goal?",
          "answer": "None of the money invested goes through and it goes right back to the investor. You are allowed to start a new campaign a month after the closing date of the failed one. Use this 30-day buffer to gain more followers, improve your numbers, and do anything that might boost your investments for the new campaign."

          "question": "How do I engage with all of my investors once the campaign is closed?",
          "answer": "It's up to you to keep your investors updated with regular communications about your company's progress. At a minimum, we encourage quarterly financial updates via email or newsletter be sent to your investors. This way, they can provide input, advice, or connections that might be helpful for you."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it possible to extend my deadline if the fundraising goal has not been met?",
          "answer": "Yes. However, this is a material change that requires all of your investors to reconfirm their investment, so note that you might lose some investors. Sill, it's a better option than failing."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will investors contact me directly?",
          "answer": "You can choose to have your email address available on your campaign page, or you may opt out and then all communications with investors are handled within the portal."
