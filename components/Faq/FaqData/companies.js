    question: "Why should I consider crowdfunding to raise capital?",
    answer:
      "A crowd of investors can validate your product in a way that institutional investors cannot. They understand your product from a customer standpoint and can give you feedback from the platform. With crowdfunding, if they're already customers, now you're enabling them to become owners, and with that you'll have brand ambassadors."

  {
    question:
      "Are there legal issues I need to be aware of when creating a campaign?",
    answer:
      "When you build a crowdfunding campaign, the biggest watchout is making any false promises. As a new company, you can't predict the future, so promising explicit revenue targets and specific growth numbers can be misleading. You are liable for every statement that is not true. Since you're dealing with investors now, you also cannot withhold relevant information that could affect their decision to invest (e.g. a pending lawsuit). Read our Legal Fast Start Guide for more information."

Per legal guidelines, you are not allowed to say, 'we plan to begin fundraising on July 4th a total raise of $500K.' You must also avoid saying things like, 'Once we file with the SEC...' They frown upon that."

  {
    question:
      "What legal considerations should I be concerned about when advertising?",
    answer:
      "You can promote after the form C is filed with the SEC. Importantly, filing a Form C is not an 'approval' or 'endorsement' from the SEC. So definitely avoid advertising with any statements referring to the SEC. At this point, you can advertise in any channel you want, whether it's email, social media, youtube, or on a flyer you pass out on the streets. What's important is that your advertisements must be based on objective facts about your company. You certainly cannot say 'Invest in the the Best darn company on the planet'). All your adverstising must include a link to your Wunderfund.co profile. More info about this is within our Legal Guide."
