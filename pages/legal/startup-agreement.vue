        I have read the Terms of Use (the "Terms of Use") and understand that
        the Terms of Use govern my use of the Services (as defined in the Terms
        of Use). If I am accessing the Services on behalf of a Startup (as
        defined in the Terms of Use), my agreement to this Startup Agreement
        will be treated as the agreement of both me as an individual and for
        Startup, and all references to "I" or "you" herein shall include
        Startup.
      </p>
      <p>
        I represent and warrant to Wunderfund.co and its affiliates
        (collectively, "Wunderfund") that the information submitted about
        Startup is correct and complete. I understand and agree that if any
        event occurs or circumstance arises that causes the information in
        Startup's profile to be untrue or misleading in any material respect,
        then I must update such information to make it true and correct in all
        material respects prior to using the Services to raise capital. I agree
        that I am fully responsible for the accuracy of any information related
        to Startup that I upload, and I am fully responsible for any and all
        consequences and claims related to any investment that is made in
        Startup through the Services in reliance upon such information.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that the offer and sale of securities - including, without
        limitation, stock, options, convertible debt, warrants and other similar
        instruments - is regulated by federal and state law ("Securities Laws"),
        and that if I use the services to conduct any transaction involving
        securities I must do so in compliance with applicable securities laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that Wunderfund.co makes no representation or warranty that
        transactions conducted through the site will be in compliance with
        applicable securities laws. I acknowledge that use of the services
        available through the services to conduct any transaction involving
        securities does not constitute compliance with applicable securities
        laws, and may violate applicable securities laws in certain
        jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that Wunderfund.co is a "Funding Portal" but is not a
        "Broker" or "Dealer", as those terms are defined in Section 3(a) of the
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to, and not in limitation of, the disclaimers, exclusions on
        warranties and limitations on liability set forth in the terms of use, I
        a gree that to the fullest extent permitted by law, Wunderfund.co shall
        have no liability for any losses arising from or related to any
        transaction in securities conducted through the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to, and not in limitation of, the indemnity set forth in the
        Terms of Use, I agree to defend Wunderfund.co and its affiliates,
        licensors and assignees and their respective officers, directors,
        managers, members, agents, partners and employees (the "Wunderfund
        Indemnitees"), from and against any and all claims, actions, suits,
        demands or other proceedings brought by or on behalf of any third party,
        and to indemnify and hold the Wunderfund Indemnitees harmless against
        any losses, liabilities and other damages including, but not limited to,
        reasonable attorneys' fees, in any case arising out of or related to my
        use of the Site and the Services in connection with any transaction in
        securities. I understand this defense and indemnification obligation
        will survive following the termination of my use of the Site and the
        Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that Wunderfund.co shall have the right, but not the obligation,
        to list Startup as a customer who uses the Services and in materials
        promoting the Services. I further agree that if I use the Services to
        raise capital for Startup, Wunderfund.co has the right, during and after
        the term of this Agreement, to list Startup and details of the
        transaction on the Services and in materials promoting the Services.
