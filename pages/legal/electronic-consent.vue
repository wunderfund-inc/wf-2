      I agree that any time I click or have clicked on an "I Agree", "I Consent"
      or other similarly worded button or entry field with my mouse, keystroke
      or other device, my agreement or consent is legally binding and
      enforceable against me and is the legal equivalent of my handwritten
      signature on an agreement that is printed on paper. I agree to be bound by
      any affirmation, assent or agreement that I transmit, or have transmitted,
      to or through this website (the "Platform") by computer or other
      electronic device, including internet, telephonic and wireless devices,
      including but not limited to any consent I give or have given to receive
      communications from Wunderfund.co or any of its affiliates ("Wunderfund")
      solely through electronic transmission.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any notices,
      disclosures, forms, privacy statements, reports or other communications,
      including any tax-related information or documents to the extent provided
      below (collectively, "Communications"), regarding the investments
      available on the Platform, and my investment in any such investments, may
      be delivered by electronic means, such as by e-mail or through
      Wunderfund.co. I consent to electronic delivery as described in the
      preceding sentence. In so consenting, I acknowledge that e-mail messages
      are not secure and may contain computer viruses or other defects, may not
      be accurately replicated on other systems or may be intercepted, deleted
      or interfered with, with or without the knowledge of the sender or the
      intended recipient. I also acknowledge that an e-mail from Wunderfund may
      be accessed by recipients other than me and may be interfered with, may
      contain computer viruses or other defects and may not be successfully
      replicated on other systems. I understand that Wunderfund gives no
      warranties in relation to these matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I consent to the delivery of tax documents through the Platform. I
      understand that I may withdraw this consent before my tax document is
      furnished. In providing this consent, I also acknowledge that I have
      received Wunderfund's Information on the Electronic Delivery of Tax
      Documents, included below.
    </p>
    <p>I further understand and agree to each of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As long as my consent remains in effect, Wunderfund may provide all
        Communications to me electronically in lieu of providing paper
        Communications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hardware and software that I will need. Electronic Communications may be
        provided to me via e-mail and/or the Platform. In order to view and
        retain the Communications, my computer hardware and software must, at a
        minimum, be capable of accessing the Internet, with connectivity to an
        Internet Service Provider or any other capable communications medium,
        and with software capable of viewing and printing a *.pdf file created
        by Adobe Acrobat. Further, I must have a personal e-mail address capable
        of sending and receiving email messages to and from Wunderfund. To print
        the documents, I will need access to a printer compatible with my
        hardware and the required software.
      </li>
      <li>
        If these software or hardware requirements change in the future,
        Wunderfund will notify me through the Platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        To facilitate these services, I must provide Wunderfund with my current
        e-mail address and update that information as necessary. Unless
        otherwise required by law, I will be deemed to have received any
        electronic Communications that are sent to the most current e-mail
        address that I have provided to Wunderfund.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wunderfund will not assume liability for non-receipt of notification of
        the availability of electronic Communications in the event my e-mail
        address on file is invalid, my e-mail or Internet service provider
        filters the notification as "spam" or "junk mail," there is a
        malfunction in my computer, browser, Internet service and/or software,
        or for any other reasons beyond the control of Wunderfund.
      </li>
      <li>
        I may withdraw my consent to receive Communications in electronic form
        by calling Wunderfund at (513) 601-9350. If I withdraw my consent to
        receive Communications in electronic form, Wunderfund may, at its option
        and in its sole discretion, (A) terminate my account with Wunderfund
        that was created through the Platform ("My Account"), (B) restrict or
        limit the actions I may take through or with respect to My Account,
        including, but not limited to, restricting my ability to purchase
        Wunderfund investment through My Account, and (C) charge me a fee of $5
        for each paper copy of each Communication that would have been provided
        to me electronically if I had not withdrawn my consent. Any withdrawal
        of my consent to receive electronic Communications will not affect or
        impact in any way the terms of my agreement to the Terms of Use
        Agreement for the Platform.

      Information on Electronic Delivery of Tax Documents
    </h3>
    <p>
      These provisions relate to my consent above to Wunderfund's provision of
      tax documents to me electronically. Prior to furnishing the tax documents
      electronically, the Internal Revenue Service requires that Wunderfund
      provide each investor with the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If I do not consent to receive the tax document electronically, a paper
        copy will be provided.
      </li>
      <li>
        My consent continues for every tax year until I withdraw my consent.
      </li>
      <li>
        I may log into My Account at Wunderfund.co to access and print my tax
        documents. I may need Adobe Acrobat Reader to open the document and a
        device connected to my computer that can print. In the event a tax
        document is too large to open in the browser, I will be prompted by a
        dialog box to save the file to a location on my computer and open it
        using Acrobat Reader.
      </li>
      <li>
        To withdraw consent, I may call Wunderfund at (513) 601-9350 to request
        to withdraw my consent.
      </li>
      <li>
        If My Account is closed, my request for electronic delivery of tax
        documents will automatically terminate, and I will receive a paper copy
        of my tax documents by mail at the address that I have provided to
        Wunderfund.
      </li>
      <li>
        I may update my contact information by calling Wunderfund at (513)
        601-9350.
      </li>
      <li>
        My tax documents are maintained for 10 years on Wunderfund.co in case I
        ever need to access them again.
