            "Are there legal issues I need to be aware of when making a profile?",
          answer:
            "When you build a crowdfunding campaign, the biggest thing to watch out for is making any false promises. As a new company, you can't predict the future, so promising explicit revenue targets and specific growth numbers can be misleading. You are liable for every statement that is not true. Since you're dealing with investors now, you also cannot withhold relevant information that could affect their decision to invest (e.g. a pending lawsuit). For more information on the Crowdfunding Rules for Issuers, please visit THIS SITE."

          answer:
            "Before you can issue an offering on Wunderfund.co, you have to apply and tell us about your team and your company. All Issuers must also meet the minimum requirements set forth by the rules of Regulation Crowdfunding. If you have questions about your eligibility based on these rules, then please contact Wunderfund and we will let you know. Passing this process is not meant to be construed as investment advice or endorsement by Wunderfund.co."
