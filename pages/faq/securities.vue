                <strong>What are SAFEs?</strong>
              </summary>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  A SAFE is an agreement between you, the investor, and the
                  company in which the company generally promises to give you a
                  future equity stake in the company if certain trigger events
                  occur.
                </strong>
                Not all SAFEs are the same and the very important terms
                governing when you may get the future equity may vary across the
                SAFEs being offered in different crowdfunding offerings.
                <strong>
                  <i>Despite its name, a SAFE may not be "simple" or "safe."</i>

                <strong>What is important to keep in mind about SAFEs?</strong>
              </summary>
              <p>
                It is important to understand the terms of any SAFE in which you
                are investing through a crowdfunding offering. Here are some
                things to keep in mind:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    The most important thing to realize about SAFEs is that you
                    are not getting an equity stake in return. SAFEs are not
                    common stock.
                  </strong>
                  Common stock represents an ownership stake in a company and
                  entitles you to certain rights under state corporate law and
                  federal securities law. A SAFE, on the other hand, is an
                  agreement to provide you a future equity stake based on the
                  amount you invested if—and only if—a triggering event occurs.
                  <strong>
                    <i>
                      SAFEs do not represent a current equity stake in the
                      company in which you are investing. Instead, the terms of
                      the SAFE have to be met in order for you to receive your
                      equity stake.
                    </i>
                  </strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    <i>
                      SAFEs may only convert to equity if certain triggering
                      events occur.
                    </i>
                  </strong>
                  Because SAFEs convert to actual equity in the future based on
                  some future event, it is important to understand what exactly
                  triggers the conversion of the SAFE. The terms of the SAFE may
                  have it trigger in a number of different scenarios that may—or
                  may not—occur in the future with respect to the company. For
                  example, a SAFE may be triggered if the company is acquired by
                  or merged with another company. Other triggers may be an

                  of securities by the company or another round of financing
                  involving equity securities.

                <li>
                  <strong>
                    <i>Depending on its terms, a SAFE may not be triggered.</i>
                  </strong>
                  Despite the identified triggers for conversion of the SAFE,
                  there may be scenarios in which the triggers are not activated
                  and the SAFE is not converted, leaving you with nothing. For
                  example, if a company in which you invested makes enough money
                  that it never again needs to raise capital, and it is not
                  acquired by another company, then the conversion of the SAFE
                  may never be triggered.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In another example, if a SAFE specifically triggers upon an
                offering of preferred stock, but the company subsequently raises
                money by instead selling more SAFEs, common stock or convertible
                notes, or by getting a conventional bank loan, then the SAFE
                will not convert despite the company having raised more capital.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  Convertible notes are another type of security that has been
                  offered in crowdfunding opportunities.
                </strong>
                Convertible notes are essentially debt obligations in which the
                investor agrees to loan money to the company. In exchange, the
                investor receives a promise of repayment, interest on the loan
                for a period of time and an ability to convert the outstanding
                amount into equity of the company at some triggering event.
                <strong>
                  <i>
                    Different from SAFEs, convertible notes generally represent
                    a current legal obligation by the company to you for the
                    outstanding amount of the note.
                  </i>
                </strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    <i>Keep in mind other possible provisions of the SAFE.</i>
                  </strong>
                  In addition to the trigger mechanism, there are also other
                  components of SAFEs that you should understand. Some things to
                  better understand include the following:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong><i>Conversion terms.</i></strong> These are the
                      specific terms by which the amount you invested in the
                      SAFE gets converted into equity. Is it just your original
                      investment or does the SAFE provide for an amount that
                      offers value over time similar to interest on a loan? How
                      does the valuation of the company at the future financing
                      play into how many shares you will get upon conversion of
                      your SAFE?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong><i>Repurchase rights.</i></strong> Is there a
                      provision in the SAFE that allows the company to
                      repurchase your future right to equity instead of it being
                      converted to equity? Do you have any say into whether your
                      right is repurchased and at what price?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong><i>Dissolution rights.</i></strong> What happens
                      to your SAFE and the money you invested if the company
                      ends up dissolving?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong><i>Voting rights.</i></strong> SAFEs do not
                      represent current equity stakes in the company so do not
                      have voting rights similar to common stock. But are there
                      particular circumstances mentioned in the SAFE that allow
                      you a voice on matters pertaining to your SAFE?
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    <i>SAFEs were designed for a specific type of startup.</i>
                  </strong>
                  SAFEs were developed in Silicon Valley as a way for venture
                  capital investors to quickly invest in a hot startup without
                  burdening the startup with the more labored negotiations an
                  equity offering may entail. Oftentimes, for the venture
                  capital investor, it was more important to get the investment
                  opportunity, and possible future opportunities, with the
                  startup than it was to protect the relatively small investment
                  represented by the SAFE. In addition, the various mechanisms
                  of the SAFE, from the triggering events to the conversion
                  terms, were designed to best operate in the context of a fast
                  growing startup likely to need and attract additional capital
                  from sophisticated venture capital investors. This may or may
                  not be the case with the crowdfunding investment opportunity
                  you are exploring.

                  <strong>
                    <i>There is nothing standard or simple about a SAFE.</i>
                  </strong>
                  Various terms from the triggering events to the conversion
                  price are subject to different treatment by different
                  companies offering SAFEs. It is important to read and
                  understand the company’s disclosure regarding the SAFE it is
                  offering as well as the terms set forth in the actual
                  agreement.
