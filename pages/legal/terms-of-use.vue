            REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT WUNDERFUND OR THE
            WUNDERFUND PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
            DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE,
            ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE
            SERVICES. YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICES IS
            TO STOP USING THE SERVICES.

            <strong>Liability.</strong> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WUNDERFUND
            OR THE WUNDERFUND PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT
            LOSSES OR DAMAGES, WITH YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE ANY
            SERVICES. THIS IS A COMPREHENSIVE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY THAT
            APPLIES TO ALL LOSSES OF ANY KIND. THE ALLOCATION OF RISK SET FORTH
            IN THESE TERMS IS AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND
            WUNDERFUND. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY ONLY COMMENCE A CAUSE OF ACTION
            RELATED TO THE SERVICES WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF SUCH ACTION ACCRUING,
            AND ANY ATTEMPT TO BRING SUCH AN ACTION AFTER SUCH ONE (1) YEAR
            PERIOD IS BARRED. Some jurisdictions do not permit limitations of
            liability and in those jurisdictions some of the foregoing
            limitations may not apply to you. The limitations in these Terms
            shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.

            <strong>Indemnification.</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold
            harmless Wunderfund and the Wunderfund Parties from and against any
            and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, costs,
            and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs)
            brought by third-parties arising out of, related to, or that may
            arise in connection with any actual or alleged violation or breach
            of any of the representations, warranties, agreements, or promises
            made by you in these Terms.

            <strong>Modification.</strong> Wunderfund may modify these Terms.
            You should review the Terms regularly. Wunderfund will post notice
            of modifications to these Terms on the Services. If you do not agree
            to the modified terms for the Services, you should discontinue your
            use of the Services.

          <p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              You and Wunderfund each agree to first contact each other with any
              disputes and provide a written description of the problem, all
              relevant documents or information, and the proposed resolution.
              You agree to contact us with disputes by contacting us at
              taylor@wunderfund.co. We will contact you based on the contact
              information you have provided us.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you and Wunderfund cannot resolve any dispute after 30 days,
              the party seeking to pursue a claim will submit the claim to
              arbitration consistent with this section. The parties understand
              that they would have had a right or opportunity to litigate
              disputes through a court and to have a judge or jury decide their
              case, but they choose to have any disputes resolved through
              arbitration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any claim or dispute between you and Wunderfund, and any claim by
              either against any agent, employee, successor, or assign of the
              other, including third parties, whether related to these Terms or
              otherwise, including past, present, and future claims and
              disputes, and including any dispute as to the validity or
              applicability of this arbitration clause, shall be resolved by
              binding arbitration administered by the JAMS under its rules and
              procedures in effect when the claim is filed. The rules and
              procedures and other information, including information on fees,
              may be obtained from the
              <b-link href="wwwjamsadr.com">JAMS website</b-link> or by calling
              JAMS at 949-224- 1810.
            </li>
            <li>
              You and Wunderfund each agree that any arbitration will be solely
              between you and us, not as part of a class-wide claim. If any
              court or arbitrator determines that this class-wide restriction is
              unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate
              does not apply and the class-wide dispute must be brought in
              court.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wunderfund may pursue equitable relief in a court in connection
              with the Services without any obligation to pursue the claims in
              arbitration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nothing in this Section 21 will preclude, waiver, or otherwise
              limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action
              in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through
              the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that actions is
              available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv)
              file a suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property
              infringement claim.

            <strong>Governing Law; Venue.</strong> These Terms and the use of
            the Services will be governed by Ohio law without regard for its
            conflict of laws principles. For any claims not subject to the
            arbitration provisions of these Terms, all claims arising out of
            relating to these Terms or the Services must be litigated in the
            state or federal courts located in Cincinnati, Ohio and you and
            Wunderfund consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

            <strong>Complete Agreement.</strong> These Terms constitute the
            entire and exclusive agreement between you and Wunderfund with

            agreements, terms, and conditions applicable to the Services. The
            headers for these Terms are for convenience only and will not affect
            the interpretation of these Terms. If a provision of these Terms is
            found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full
            force and effect, and an enforceable term will be substituted
            reflecting our intent as closely as possible.

            evidence my consent to be legally bound by the User Agreement. The
            use of an electronic version of the User Agreement fully satisfies
            any requirement that they be provided in writing. You acknowledge
            that You may access and retain a record of the User Agreement
            documents that are electronically signed through the Services. You

            complete, valid, authentic, and enforceable record of the User
            Agreement, admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings to
            the same extent as if the documents and records were originally
            generated and maintained in printed form. You will not contest the
            admissibility or enforceability of the electronically signed copy of
            any part of the User Agreement.
