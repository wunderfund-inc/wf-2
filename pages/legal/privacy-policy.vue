              PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING OUR
              SERVICES
            </h3>
            <p>
              Wunderfund, Inc. ("Wunderfund" or "we"), recognizes the importance
              of the individual privacy for each user of our services
              (individually, "you" or a "User" and collectively, "Users"). This
              Privacy Policy outlines the types of Personally Identifying
              Information ("PII") Wunderfund gathers when you use any website,
              application, or other online service made available by Wunderfund
              under this Privacy Policy (each a "Service"), and how we use that
              information. This Privacy Policy also details the steps we take to
              safeguard your PII and how you can correct or update the PII
              gathered. It is important to review this Privacy Policy in its
              entirety.
            </p>
            <h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>
              <em>Information You Provide to Wunderfund.</em> "Personally
              Identifying Information" is information that individually
              identifies you, and may include your name, physical address, phone
              number, email address, date of birth, net worth, income, status as
              an accredited investor, employer identification number, social
              security number, and any other information that would allow
              someone to identify or contact you. Of course, you may choose not
              to provide Wunderfund with Personally Identifying Information.
              However, this choice may prevent Wunderfund from providing you
              with the information or Services requested or that could be
              offered.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you invest in an offering through Wunderfund, we will collect
              payment information from you, such as financial account
              information or payment card information, and we may collect
              information to verify your income.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you would like to raise funding through Wunderfund, we collect
              information about you and your business, your fundraising terms,
              and payment information.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Third-Party Services.</em> If you register for the Services
              through third-party social networking or authentication services
              (a "Credential Party"), such as Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter, we
              will collect Personally Identifying Information that you have
              provided to the Credential Party (such as your name, email
              address, photo, and other information you make available via the
              Credential Party) and an authentication token from the Credential
              Party. The Personally Identifying Information collected from the
              Credential party may be used to register you on the Services. You
              may revoke our access to your account with a Credential Party at
              any time by updating the appropriating settings in the account
              preferences of the respective Credential Party. You understand
              that certain features of the Services may not be available to you
              if you choose to remove our access to your account with the
              Credential Party.

                  Like many online services, we use various technologies to
                  collect usage data and store preferences. One such technology
                  is called a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that is
                  transferred to your computer's hard disk. We may use both
                  session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand
                  how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate
                  usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Services.
                  Also, we may create a unique device or user ID for you and
                  store it in a cookie so we can recognize you and customize
                  your experience based on your preferences. Most web browsers
                  are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can
                  usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser
                  cookies or to prompt you before accepting such a cookie.
                  Please note that if you choose to remove or reject browser
                  cookies, this could affect the availability or functionality
                  of the Services. We may also use web beacons as part of the
                  Services.

              addition to the individual data use described in this Privacy
              Policy, we may aggregate information about you and other
              individual users together, or otherwise de-identify the

              you personally. We may use information in these forms for a
              variety of purposes, including for research and analysis,

            <h3>Public Forums</h3>
            <p>
              You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose any PII in
              a public forum available on the Services, this information, along
              with any information disclosed in your communication, can be
              collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited
              messages from third parties. Such activities are beyond our
              control and this Privacy Policy does not apply to such
              information. You accept that you, and not Wunderfund, are
              responsible for providing such information in any public forum.
              Any submissions to public areas on the Services are accepted by
              you with the understanding that such forums are accessible to all
              third parties. If you do not want your comments or any content to
              be viewed by third parties, you should not submit comments or
              contents on public forums.
            </p>
            <h3>Safeguards</h3>
            <p>
              Wunderfund has implemented information security safeguards
              designed to protect your PII. Unfortunately, neither the network
              nor data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be
              100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect a User's
              information, Wunderfund cannot ensure or warrant the security of
              PII or other information submitted through a Service. Thus, any
              information a User transmits to us is done so at the User's own
              risk.
            </p>
            <h3>Online Tracking</h3>
            <p>
              The Services do not respond to Do Not Track signals. Third parties
              cannot collect PII about you when you use a Service.
            </p>
            <h3>Accountability and Compliance</h3>
            <p>
              You may address any question regarding how Wunderfund complies
              with this Privacy Policy to the e-mail address set forth in this
              Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h3>Third-Party Websites</h3>
            <p>
              On occasion, the Services are connected by "hyperlinks" to other
              third parties' websites. Please note that Wunderfund is not
              responsible in any way for the privacy practices of other websites
              and suggests that you review the privacy policies of those other
              companies' websites before using them.
            </p>
            <h3>Accessing/Updating Your Personally Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>
              You can access your information in your account profile settings,
              as well as during investment checkout. You can update the
              information you provided Uus in these settings as well. Your
              profile will always be hidden from public view as well as search
              engines that collect information from our websites. Information
              will be publicly shown only in a public forum where communication
              between you and the Issuer has been established on the homepage of
              this site. If you are within the EU, we can provide you a copy of
              your personal records we hold on this site and your communications
              with the Issuer.
            </p>
            <p>
              You also have the right to ask Wunderfund to correct any
              information regarding your PII on Agreements, Third Party Services
              we use, or information saved in our database.
            </p>
            <h3>Disabling or Deleting Account</h3>
            <p>
              You can either temporarily disable or permanently delete your
              account through Wunderfund. If you disable your account, we log
              you out of your account, but we will save your information in case
              you later decide to reactivate your account.
            </p>
            <p>
              You have the right to delete certain account information through
              your profile settings. If you intend to delete your account
              altogether, we will permanently delete your account information
              and we will delete your messages according to our regular
              retention schedule. Please note that we will continue to store
              certain information for analytics purposes, but that information
              will not include your personal information such as name, email
              address, or telephone number. Also, please note any information
              disclosed on the Public Forum will not be deleted, as per our
              requirements to comply with FINRA regulations. We will also retain
              any other information as required by law.
            </p>
            <h3>Social Media Features and Widgets</h3>
            <p>
              The Services include social media features and widgets. These
              features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting
              through the Services, other applicable information, and may set a
              cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media
              functions are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly
              through the Services. Your interactions with these features are
              governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.
            </p>
            <h3>Minors</h3>
            <p>
              The Services are not intended for people under the age of 18.
              Further, we do not knowingly collect PII from children under the
              age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the
              age of 18 and believe he or she has disclosed PII to us, please

            <h3>Consent to Transfer</h3>
            <p>
              Please be aware that information we collect through the Service
              may be transferred to and processed in the United States, where
              the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the
              country where you reside or are a citizen. By using the Services
              or providing Wunderfund with any information, you consent to
              transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the
              United States or such other countries as Wunderfund choose in its
              sole discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are within the EU, we will provide to you, or a third party
              you have chosen, your PII in a structured, commonly used,
              machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to
              automated information which you initially provided consent for us
              to use by agreeing to our terms.
            </p>

              Policy by either sending you an email or by including prominent
